##  Overview
Performed **CEA simulations** to study the effect of **equivalence ratio** on flame temperature and pollutant formation for Jet-A, Ethanol, Methanol, and their blends.

##  Method
- Fuels: Jet-A, Ethanol, Methanol, and Jet-A + 20%/50% Ethanol or Methanol  
- Conditions: Constant enthalpy, constant pressure, initial T = 298 K, ϕ = 0.5–1.5  
- Tool: NASA **CEA Program**

## Results
- Jet-A shows higher flame temperature compared to blends  
- CO₂ peaks at stoichiometric, CO increases in rich conditions  
- NO formation peaks near stoichiometric equivalence ratio  
- Alcohol blends reduce flame temperature and pollutant emissions
